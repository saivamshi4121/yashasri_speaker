## What are we doing today?
Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

1. Be clear & specific: Avoid vague instructions.
2. Add context/examples: Improve quality with relevant samples.
3. Guide reasoning: Use "Let's think step-by-step" to boost logical output.
4. Assign roles: Help models match tone/expertise.
5. Test multiple prompts: Find what works best.
6. Break down tasks: Use chaining for complex processes.

Types of Prompting

Prompting is the art of crafting clear instructions for AI models using natural language. It helps guide the model‚Äôs reasoning, improve accuracy, and ensure structured and relevant responses.

Below are the most effective types of prompting techniques with practical use cases and examples.

1. Zero-Shot Prompting
Ask the model to perform a task without giving any examples.
It is best for simple, common tasks.

Use Cases:
a. Summarization
b. Translation
c. Direct question answering

Example Prompt:
Summarize the sentence : "Artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing field that focuses on building systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence."

2. Few-Shot Prompting
Provide 2‚Äì3 examples to show the model what kind of response is expected.
Ideal for tasks needing consistency or format adherence.

Use Cases:
a. Text formatting
b. Pattern matching
c. Style transfer

Example Prompt:
Q: Convert 'data science' to PascalCase  

A: DataScience
Q: Convert 'student login' to PascalCase  
A: StudentLogin
Q: Convert 'account settings' to PascalCase  
A:

3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Guide the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving the answer. It boosts logical and math-based tasks.

Use Cases:
a. Math problems
b. Code analysis
c. Logical reasoning

Example Prompt:
Q: There are 10 cookies. Alice eats 3, and Bob eats 2. How many are left?  
Let's think step-by-step.

4. Prompt Chaining
Break down complex tasks into multiple connected prompts and output of one prompt becomes input for the next.

Use Cases:
a. Task automation
b. Multi-step workflows
c. LangChain, N8N integrations

Example Workflow:

Step 1 Prompt:  
Summarize the following GitHub issue:  
"The login button doesn't work on mobile devices running Safari."

Step 2 Prompt:  
Write a professional email to the mobile dev team with the summary:
"The login button is broken on Safari mobile. Needs urgent fix."

5. Role Prompting
Assign a persona or role to the model to influence the tone or expertise level.

Use Cases:

a. Professional reviews
b. Teaching or explaining concepts
c. Simulated interviews

Example Prompt:
You are a senior software architect.  
Please review the following microservices design for performance and scalability issues.

6. Self-Consistency Prompting
Run the same prompt multiple times and compare the outputs. It is useful for creative or open-ended responses.

Use Cases:
a. Brainstorming
b. Storytelling
c. Metaphor generation

Example Prompt:

Question: Calculate 15% of 240

Path 1:
- 10% of 240 = 24
- 5% is half of 10% = 12
- Total: 24 + 12 = 36

Path 2:
- Convert 15% to decimal: 0.15
- Multiply: 240 √ó 0.15 = 36

Path 3:
- Break down into: (240 √ó 10/100) + (240 √ó 5/100)
- = 24 + 12
- = 36

All paths converge on 36, indicating high confidence in the answer.

## Developer's Guide to AI Evolution & Prompt Engineering
## 1. Our Progress Over Time
From Basic Tools to AI-Powered Development

Historical Context:

1980s: Monochrome IDEs with limited functionality

2020s: AI-assisted coding with real-time suggestions and error detection

## Example:

python
 Old: Manual code completion
 New: AI suggests complete functions based on comments
## 2. GitHub Copilot in Action
Real-World Prompt Engineering for Developers

## Effective Prompt Patterns:
text
# As a senior Python developer, write a Flask endpoint that:
# - Accepts JSON input
# - Validates email format
# - Returns 400 if invalid

Debugging with CoT:

## 3. Expanding AI Use Cases

Prompt Engineering Across Domains
Domain	Prompt Technique	
## Example
DevOps	Few-Shot Prompting	"Convert these YAML to Terraform: [examples]"
Customer Support	Role Prompting	"As a support agent, respond to: 'My order is late'"
Technical Writing	Zero-Shot + Constraints	"Explain Kubernetes pods (1 paragraph, non-technical)"

## 4. Accelerating Work with RAG Systems
Advanced Prompt Chaining for Knowledge Retrieval

Workflow Example:

## Retrieval Prompt:
"Extract key points from our API documentation about authentication"

## Generation Prompt:
"Using these points, create a troubleshooting guide for auth errors (markdown)"

Example Problem: "A bakery had 50 cupcakes. They sold 15 in the morning and then baked 20 more in the afternoon. How many cupcakes do they have now?"

**Expected CoT Response:**

1. Start with the initial number of cupcakes: 50.
2. Subtract the number of cupcakes sold in the morning: \( 50 - 15 = 35 \).
3. Add the number of cupcakes baked in the afternoon: \( 35 + 20 = 55 \).
4. The bakery now has 55 cupcakes.

Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.
